Infectious diseases are an increasing threat to human health and as the world becomes more connected, it becomes more epidemic prone. 

The field of epidemic intelligence exists as a response to this threat. Epidemic intelligence is about more than just keeping an eye on disease reports. It is about gathering and processing data that it actionable, accessible and easy to interprete by epidemiologists and policy makers alike. With artifical inteliligence, we can make this process quick, current and thorough.

This project leans on the epidemic intelligence framework to develop a baseline model for influenza data using data from [WHO Flunet](https://apps.who.int/flumart/Default?ReportNo=12).
